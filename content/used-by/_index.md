The Sikshana Foundation is supporting over 50&nbsp;thousand schools in India with
their programs, as part of this they use SDAPS in their infrastructure. In
addition to this work, they are also cooperating with the Karnataka state
Government on a State Achievement Survey (SAS) which has been run twice as of
2019. This unique data collection effort was powered by SDAPS at its core. In
2018, 4.2&nbsp;million students from grade 4&nbsp;to&nbsp;10 were assessed for their performance
in different subjects. Using this information, the Sikshana Foundation was able
to send colorful motivating report cards with feedback to each individual
student. In addition to this the collaboration resulted in valuable
data for the Government of Karnataka to improve the quality of
education in the future. For their collaboration with the Karnataka Government
the Sikshana Foundation has been recognized as the “IT Backbone to Edu Dept”.

When we decided to implement scannable walk and call sheets at NationBuilder,
we spent a lot of time evaluating different open source solutions.  Initially
what drew us to SDAPS was the implementation language, Python, which we were
all familiar with, the accessibility of the codebase on Github, and the
availability and helpfulness of the maintainer, Benjamin Berg, on IRC.
After working with Benjamin on some changes we needed for our project, we
deployed to production. For October, running up to the end of US elections
in November, we were able to process over 22,000 unique contacts, resulting
in saving hundreds of hours of volunteer time from inputting and verifying
data manually.
