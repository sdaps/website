## Printing

After the setup of the example we now have a
[questionnaire.pdf](/files/questionnaire.pdf) in the project directory
that can be printed. This depends on the setup of the survey (done using the
documentclass options in the LaTeX document). If we make each printout unique
using a "Questionnaire-ID" then we would need to use the "stamp" command to
create the printable questionnaire. Please refer to the section at the bottom
of the page for more information.

Simply print the created PDF file using your favorite PDF reader. It is a good
idea to disable any "scale page to fit printable area" option.

## Scanning

After you have a couple of printed and filled in questionnaires you need to
scan them. There is a whole [scanning section](/documentation/scanning)
about this. Please have a look there.

You can skip this step for now and instead use the provided
[example.tif](/files/example.tif) or
[example-2.tif](/files/example-2.tif) file (the second one is required
if you have a newer version of the multicol package).
