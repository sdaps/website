Instructions:

### General Dependencies

SDAPS has a number of dependencies. In some circumstances not all of them will
be needed, but it is probably a good idea to just install everything.

general (including recognize):

* Python 3
* distutils and distutils-extra
* python-cairo (including development files)
* libtiff (including development files)
* pkg-config
* python-zbar for "code128" style
* python development files

graphical user interface (gui):

* GTK+ and introspection data
* python-gi

reportlab based reports (report):

* reportlab
* Python Imaging Library (PIL)

ODT based questionnaires (setup/stamp):

* pdftk or pyPdf (pdftk is much faster if you need questionnaire ids)
* python-pdftools

LaTeX based questionnaires (setup_tex/stamp):

* pdflatex and packages:
* PGF/TikZ
* translator (part of beamer)
* and more

LaTeX based reports:

* siunitx

Import of other image formats (convert, add `--convert`):

* python-opencv
* Poppler and introspection data
* python-gi

Debug output (annotate):

* Poppler and introspection data
* python-gi


#### Debian Wheezy/Jessie

On Debian Wheezy/Jessie you should install the following packages:
```bash
python-distutils-extra python-cairo-dev libtiff5-dev libcairo2-dev \
libglib2.0-dev python2.7-dev python-zbar python-gi python-gi-cairo \
gir1.2-gtk-3.0 python-reportlab python-imaging gir1.2-poppler-0.18 \
python-opencv pdftk # (pdftk or python-pypdf)
```

for the LaTeX class:
```bash
texlive texlive-latex-extra texlive-latex-recommended pgf latex-beamer \
# latex-beamer: (used for translations)
```

Other debian based distributions (Ubuntu, Mint) should have very similar
package names. For some packages there are also alternatives:

* `libtiff4` development files instead of libtiff5
* `python-gobject` instead of python-gi
* `gir1.0-gtk-3.0` or similar (different GObject Introspection version)


### Setup

Clone the repo while installing the submodules with `--recursive`:
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/sdaps/sdaps.git
```

If you want to install sdaps, so you can use it from the general command line,
then change in the cloned repo folder:
```bash
./setup.py install
```
or if you want to run it directly from the cloned folder:
```bash
./setup.py build
```

Please run sdaps with `--help` after installing it for a list of commands.

## Usage

In this tutorial we will go trough the lifecycle of a SDAPS project. We are
going to use an existing LaTeX questionnaire example. There are also example
scans for this questionnaire available so that you don't need to have a
scanner and printer ready right away.

### Preface

In the example we need to call the SDAPS executable. It will be called using
`sdaps` as if it installed on the system. You can also use the `sdaps.py`
script from the source directory instead. The `$`  denotes the shells
prompt, everything else is output from the program.

We are going to use `/tmp/project` as the surveys path. This is obviously a
bad idea for any real project.

### Creating the Questionnaire

The first step to conduct a survey is to design the questionnaire itself.
You'll need to take some time to first figure out what questions to ask
before designing the questionnaire.

We are going to use this [example questionnaire](/files/example.tex)
[PDF Version](/files/example.pdf) here. If you would like to play
around a bit with it, you can compile the LaTeX document yourself. Note
that you need to copy the SDAPS-LaTeX data into the directory before doing
that. It lives in the `tex` Directory of the source code or in
`$PREFIX/share/sdaps/tex` if it is installed. Where `$PREFIX` will
usually be `/usr` or `/usr/local`.

You can familiarize yourself with the LaTeX-Document and the resulting
PDF-file. Notice that the PDF has a "draft" text overlayed. This is because
the barcode at the bottom is just an example and it will change once the
project is created.

Have a look at the [LaTeX](/documentation/latex) page for some more
information about the different LaTeX macros that exists in SDAPS. You
can also change the size of the paper using the normal LaTeX methods.

### Intializing Setup

{{% warning title="Attention" %}}It is best to use the `example.tex` from this page and not a
modified version! If you modify the document the example scan will not work
later on!{{% /warning %}}

Once we are happy with the questionnaire, we can create the survey directory
that SDAPS uses to store all the data that belongs to the project.

This is the first time that we need to run an SDAPS command. The syntax for
the command is generally the following:

```bash
$ sdaps PROJECT_DIR COMMAND [arguments]
```

Where `PROJECT_DIR` is the directory for the survey, and command is the
SDAPS command that is executed. Most commands will require some arguments.
You can always get a help by running:

```bash
$ sdaps PROJECT_DIR COMMAND --help
```

So we create the project using the provided `example.tex`. The tutorial
assumes that the LaTeX file is in the current directory.

```bash
$ sdaps /tmp/project setup_tex example.tex
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- SDAPS -- setup_tex
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Title

Questionnaire
1(Head) Range Questions
1.1(Mark) How often do you use SDAPS? {1}
        never - daily
        0(Checkbox)  87.8  78.4   3.5   3.5
[SNIP]
```

Now, what does the output tell us? First the document is compiled four times.
After the first two compiles SDAPS reads all the metadata and calculates the
"Survey-ID" using the box positions and sizes and some other metadata. After
that, the document is recompiled again using the correct "Survey-ID".

The rest of the output is a textual representation of the questionnaire. We
can ignore it, especially because the "annotate" command creates a much nicer
view of everything.

### Printing

After the setup of the example we now have a
[questionnaire.pdf](/files/questionnaire.pdf) in the project directory
that can be printed. This depends on the setup of the survey (done using the
documentclass options in the LaTeX document). If we make each printout unique
using a "Questionnaire-ID" then we would need to use the "stamp" command to
create the printable questionnaire. Please refer to the section at the bottom
of the page for more information.

Simply print the created PDF file using your favorite PDF reader. It is a good
idea to disable any "scale page to fit printable area" option.

### Scanning

After you have a couple of printed and filled in questionnaires you need to
scan them. There is a whole [scanning section](/documentation/scanning)
about this. Please have a look there.

You scan skip this step for now and instead use the provided
[example.tif](/files/example.tif) or
[example-2.tif](/files/example-2.tif) file (the second one is required
if you have a newer version of the multicol package).

### Add the images to the project

Once you have a scan in the correct format you can add it to survey directory
that was created earlier. This is done using the `add` command:

``` bash
$ sdaps /tmp/project add example.tif
----------------------------------------
- SDAPS -- add
----------------------------------------
Processing example.tif
Done
```

If everything worked fine you will see no further output. The original file is
copied into the project directory as `1.tif`.

You can repeat this step if you have multiple scans.

{{% warning title="Attention" %}}Do **not** remove or modify the copied TIFF
files. SDAPS stores information that references these files (ie. it creates a
record for each page). If you accidentally added a file, you can recreate the
project and start from scratch.{{% /warning %}}


### Running the optical mark recognition

The next step is to run the optical mark recognition. This works using the
`recognize` command. So from the command line again we run:

``` bash
$ sdaps /tmp/project recognize
-------------------------------------------------
- SDAPS -- recognize
-------------------------------------------------
3 sheets
|#################################| 100% 00:00:02
0.887902 seconds per sheet
```

This step takes longer as the recognition algorithm needs to do its work for
each image. The progress bar shows how much time it is expected to take.
Usually it will take less than a second for a two page questionnaire.

### Manual correction

Sometimes the computer might not correctly identify the state of a checkbox
(SDAPS sometimes has some trouble because of the feature to uncheck a box by
filling it out).

Tocorrect any errors we can use the graphical user interface. We start it using

``` bash
$ sdaps /tmp/project gui
----------------------------------
- SDAPS -- gui
----------------------------------
```

There is a much more [complete section](/documentation/gui) about it. You can quickly go trough
all images and correct any errors using the mouse. When the view is focused
you can go forward/backward using Enter and Shift+Enter.

There is an estimation for the quality of the recognition. You can sort the
data using this estimation and only go trough the first couple of pages. The
amount of time to spend on this will depend on the required accuracy.

### Creating a PDF report

To create a PDF report with the results simply run:

``` bash
$ sdaps /tmp/project report
----------------------------------
- SDAPS -- report
----------------------------------
```

It creates a PDF file `report_1.pdf`. Have a look at the file; you can also
[download the report](/files/example_report.pdf) that will be created
for the example data.

Note that we can also do partial reports by using filters. Just a quick
example (please refer to the rest of the documentation for an explanation):

``` bash
$ sdaps /tmp/project report -f '_1_2_3 == 5'
--------------------------------------------
- SDAPS -- report
--------------------------------------------
```

This filters for question 1.2.3 (ease of use of LaTeX) and the rightmost
choice "easy".

### CSV export

Obviously sometimes it might be necessary to feed the data into another
program. For this the CSV export command was created:

``` bash
$ sdaps /tmp/project csv export
--------------------------------------------
- SDAPS -- csvdata
--------------------------------------------
```

A file called `data_1.csv` will be created in the project directory.

### Other things to try

#### Questionnaire-ID

If it is required, you can put a unique barcode on every created questionnaire.
This is internally called the "Questionnaire-ID" by SDAPS.

To do this, you need to add the `print_questionnaire_id` to the document
class before running the setup routine. The document will now also contain a
barcode for the "Questionnaire-ID" which will be located in the bottom left
corner of the page.

In this setup it is now necessary to generate the required amount of unique
documents. This is done using the `stamp` command in SDAPS. You have the
choice of either creating numeric random IDs, or supplying a set of IDs
(anything that can be encoded in CODE128 is allowed) in a file.

For example, to create 15 questionnaires with randomized IDs you can run

``` bash
$ sdaps /tmp/project stamp -r 15
```

To specify non-random IDs create a file with one ID per line. It might look
like the following. Lets call it `ids.txt`:

``` plaintext
First ID
Second ID
Some Name
```

Then run the stamp command, with the created file as an argument:

``` bash
$ sdaps /tmp/project stamp -f ids.txt
```

Both commands will create a new `stamp_X.pdf` file (where X is a number)
which can be printed.

#### Global-ID

There is a third ID that SDAPS can have (besides the internal Survey-ID and
Questionnaire-ID), which is called the "Global-ID". This ID is printed in
the center of the page and exists for user defined purposes. It is not used
by SDAPS itself but, will be exported for user defined purposes.

An example use case for the "Global-ID" might be handing out the same
questionnaire in different lectures. You could encode the lecture in the
"Global-ID" and separate everything using this information.

#### Annotate

As mentioned before, you can create a PDF to see if the values read from the
designed questionnaire are all correct (checkbox positions, etc.). To use run:

``` bash
$ sdaps /tmp/project annotate
```

The file `annotated_questionnaire.pdf` is created. Might be a bit ugly,
but one can easily check that everything is good.

{{% warning title="Attention" %}}This command requires the GObject
Introspection binding information for poppler to be installed.
{{% /warning %}}

#### Reorder

To try out this command we need a questionnaire that is printed on multiple
pages, and unique Questionnaire-IDs.

If the questionnaire has multiple pages it can happen that the pages get
mixed before the scan happens. The "reorder" command will sort all pages
so that everything is together again.

First identify all pages ie. read all the barcodes:

```bash
$ sdaps /tmp/project recognize --identify
```

Then reorder the pages:

```bash
$ sdaps /tmp/project reorder
```

And when that is done you can do the normal "recognize" step:

```bash
$ sdaps /tmp/project recognize
```

#### Using a camera for input

It is possible to use a cell phone camera image instead of a scanner. Usually
it is a lot faster to use a feed scanner, but there may be certain cases where
this is useful.

Some example images are in [cellphone.tar](/files/cellphone.tar) or
[cellphone-2.tar](/files/cellphone-2.tar) (the second one is required
if you have a newer version of the multicol package). To try it, extract the
archive (in this example to /tmp/ and then run the following commands:

``` bash
$ sdaps /tmp/project convert --3d-transform /tmp/cellphone/*.jpg --output /tmp/out.tif
$ sdaps /tmp/project add /tmp/out.tif
```

The `--3d-transform` is important as the SDAPS main Program only does a
2D transformation which is not good enough for camera images (as they usually
will not be taken exactly from above).

After this, the normal recognize step is done.

{{% warning title="Attention" %}}This only works if the tolerance is large
enough. You need a version above 1.1.4 or git, or you have to modify
`defs.py` and change the value of `corner_mark_min_length` to
something smaller (e.g. 15).{{% /warning %}}

### LaTeX based report

You can create a report that is rendered using LaTeX.

```bash
$ sdaps /tmp/project report_tex
```

{{% warning title="Attention" %}}This command requires the siunitx LaTeX
package to work properly.{{% /warning %}}
