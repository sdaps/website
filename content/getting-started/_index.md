In this tutorial we will go trough the lifecycle of a SDAPS project. We are
going to use an existing LaTeX questionnaire example. You can download example
documents and scans to try out all the steps.

## Preface

This tutorial assumes that SDAPS is installed on the system and the `sdaps`
command is available for use. You will need to use a terminal to run the
different steps and you should know the basics of using the command line to
continue.

The tutorial uses the path `/tmp/project` which will be automatically deteled
(e.g. when you reboot the computer).

See [Installation](../install) if you have not yet installed SDAPS.
