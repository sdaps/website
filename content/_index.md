SDAPS is an open source (GPLv3, LPPL) optical mark recognition (OMR) program.
It is written in python and has an integrated workflow with LaTeX to create questionnaires.

Watch the presentation at FrOSCon 2015 to get to know sdaps more (does of
course not include the latest novelties):

![SDAPS Overview](/files/sdaps.png")

With SDAPS you create the questionnaire using [LaTeX](documentation/latex/).
After this some processing is done to collect the information
about the survey (questions, and answers) and a
[printable PDF](files/questionnaire.pdf) is created.
The filled out questionnaires only need to be scanned in
([example](files/example.tif)).

SDAPS will do the optical mark recognition and can create a PDF report
([example](files/example-report.pdf)) or export the data. Optionally it is
possible to [manually correct the results](documentation/gui/) using a graphical user interface.

Possible use cases for SDAPS include:

* anonymous surveys
* non-anonymous surveys
* evaluation of lectures
* automated data input
* examinations
