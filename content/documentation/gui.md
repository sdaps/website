## Graphical User Interface for manual corrections

The graphical user interface is a GTK+ program that can be used to manually correct errors.

Getting started
---------------

The application is started in the same way as other SDAPS commands:

``` bash
$ sdaps /path/to/project gui
```

## Interface

The interface is quite simple, but has the most important features. Using the
toolbar you can switch pages, change the zoom and switch into full screen mode.
There are also some options that are specific to the currently shown page.
With this it may be possible to "rescue" broken scans that SDAPS could not
work with. It is quite unlikely that you ever need this. The "Sheet Valid"
button marks whether  the the current questionnaire should be included in
the final report or data export.

Using the "Sort by Quality" button you can sort by the detection quality.
This way you can quickly check the questionnaires that are most likely to
contain errors.

### Modifying the Data
In the view below you are shown the scanned image with  the detected results
already marked. Checkboxes are blue boxes that are filled if they are checked.
You can simply click them to toggle the state.

Freeform fields that contain text have a thicker border. You can drag each
of the four sides to select the area that contains writing. Again, clicking
into the box toggles the state (ie. whether there is text or not).

The widget will keep its current scroll position when switching pages. This
means you can set up the scale and scroll position once to see the whole
questionnaire, and then only need to tab forward/backward. Using this
feature corrections can be done very quickly. It can make sense to change
the rotation of the monitor to have a larger screen area.

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
Some of these shortcuts only work if the preview window is selected.
ie. you need to click on the image before using them.

| Shift+Tab  | Go to previous Page
| Enter      | Go to next Page and set "Sheet Validated"
| Shift+Enter| Go to previous Page and set "Sheet Validated"

#### Mouse Interaction
